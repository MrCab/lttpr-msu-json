Track List - http://alttp.mymm1.com/wiki/Soundtrack

## To Do
* Replace custom track for Crystal-Get with the JSON appropriate combination of the two tracks
* Fix the endings 
* * Triforce Screen should go from Victory Fanfare into Weapon Get
* * Main ending should be cut to appropriate time
* * Credits should play to MM IV Mega Man Theme
